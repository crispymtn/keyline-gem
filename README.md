# Keyline

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'keyline', github: 'crispymtn/keyline-gem'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install keyline

## Usage

Now that you have the Keyline gem installed, you can use it to connect to your Keyline account. First you need to setup your API Key, this can be done explicitly or implicitly, by setting the ENV variable KEYLINE_API_TOKEN or by adding keyline_api_token to Rails' secrets.yml file in the config dir.

```ruby
# Explicitly set an API token
Keyline.client(token: 'YOUR API KEY GOES HERE')
```

And let's create an order with a product that has a component. Also the product will have a finishing with some params we need to adjust.

```ruby
# Create the order
order = Keyline.orders.create(customer_id: 1337)

# Add a empty product
product = order.products.create(name: 'New product', category: 'book')

# Add a component to the product
product.components.create(name: 'Contents', closed_dimensions: [297, 210], front_colors: ['CMYK/Black'], back_colors: ['CMYK/Black, Pantone/501'])

# Lets add a finishing to the product (also possible with components)
finishing = product.finishings.create(stock_finishing_id: 12)

# And change the property's value
# We use the find_by method provided with each Keyline::Collection to find the
# property we want. Please not that where and find by will currently only search
# collections that have been loaded, it will not query the server. Especially with
# pagination (100+ objects) this means that you might miss objects matching your criteria.
finishing.finishing_properties.find_by(key: 'beidseitig').update_attributes(value: true)
```
